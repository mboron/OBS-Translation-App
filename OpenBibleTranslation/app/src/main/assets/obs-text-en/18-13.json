  "text": "The kings of Judah were descendants of David. Some of these kings were good men who ruled justly and worshiped God. But most of Judahâ€™s kings were evil, corrupt, and idol-worshipers. Some of the kings even sacrificed their children to false gods. The people of Judah also rebelled against God and worshiped other gods."
