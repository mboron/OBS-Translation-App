  "text": "As the soldiers arrested Jesus, Peter pulled out his sword and cut off the ear of the high priest’s servant. Jesus said, “Put the sword away! I could ask the Father for an army of angels to defend me. But I must obey my Father.” Then Jesus healed the man’s ear, and all the disciples ran away."
