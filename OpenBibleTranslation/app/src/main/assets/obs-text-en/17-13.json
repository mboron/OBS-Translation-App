  "text": "After Uriah was killed, David married Bathsheba. Later, she gave birth to David\u0027s son. God was not pleased with what David had done, so he sent the prophet Nathan to show David his sin. David repented of his sin and God forgave him. For the rest of his life, David trusted God, even in difficult times."
