  "text": "God told Abraham, “Through you, all the people groups of the earth will be blessed.” Jesus was a descendant of Abraham. All the people groups of the earth are blessed through Jesus, because everyone who believes in him becomes one of God’s chosen people, a spiritual descendant of Abraham."
